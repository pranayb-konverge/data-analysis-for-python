## PYTHON ECOSYSTEM libraries:

- pandas: The cornerstone of our Data Analysis job with Python
- matplotlib: The foundational library for visualizations. Other libraries weâ€™ll use will be built on top of matplotlib.
- numpy: The numeric library that serves as the foundation of all calculations in Python.
- seaborn: A statistical visualization tool built on top of matplotlib.
- statsmodels: A library with many advanced statistical functions.
- scipy: Advanced scientific computing, including functions for optimization, linear algebra, image processing and much more.
- scikit-learn: The most popular machine learning library for Python (not deep learning)
